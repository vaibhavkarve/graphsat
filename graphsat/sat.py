"""Functions for sat-checking Cnfs, Graphs, and MHGraphs.

Satisfiability of Cnfs
======================
A Cnf is satisfiable if there exists a truth assignment for each variable in the Cnf
such that on applying the assignment, the Cnf evaluates to True.
This module implements three different sat-solvers:

   1. cnf_bruteforce_satcheck: a brute-force solver.  This solver is easy to
      understand and reason about. It does not have other external
      dependencies. However, it is quite slow.

   2. cnf_pysat_satcheck: using the `pysat` library's Minisat22 solver.  This solver
      calls Minisat v2.2 via the pysat library. It is the fast solver in this list
      but has many external dependencies (because pysat has many dependencies).

   3. cnf_minisat_satcheck: using Minisat v2.2 as a subprocess.  This calls minisat.c
      directly as a subprocess. minisat.c is easy to obtain and install. However,
      creating subprocesses is not a very fast process.

Connection between Cnfs and MHGraphs
====================================
For every Cnf, we can construct an associated MHGraph by replacing all variables and
their negations by vertices of the same name.

Satisfiability of a MHGraph
===========================
A MHGraph is satisfiable if it has atleast one Cnf supported on it and every Cnf
supported on the MHGraph is also satisfiable.  This module implements three different
MHGraph sat-solvers:

    1. mhgraph_bruteforce_satcheck: easiest to understand and reason about.
    2. mhgraph_pysat_satcheck: faster.
    3. mhgraph_minisat_satcheck: slowest.
