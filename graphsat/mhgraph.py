"""Constructors and functions for Loopless-Multi-Hyper-Graphs.

.. _definitionofagraph:

Definition of a Loopless-Multi-Hyper-Graph
==========================================
Throughout this module, we will take the term *MHGraph* to refer to mathematical objects
with the following properties:

   - All simple graphs (as laid out on the graph.py module) are MHGraphs.
   - Hyper-edges (referred to simply as an HEdge) are allowed, meaning that an can join
     more than two vertices together.
   - Multi-edges are allowed, meaning that each HEdge comes with a non-negative
     multiplicity:
      - multiplicity one HEdges are called simple edges.
      - multiplicity zero HEdges are simply ignored.
   - Multi-hyper-edges are allowed (meaning hyper-edges can also have multiplicities).
   - Isolated vertices are allowed (single-vertex-edge are allowed -- think of these as
     self-loops).
   - Collapsed edges are not allowed, meaning an edge can be incident on a given vertex
     only once.

An *HGraph* is a MHGraph without HEdge-multiplicities.
